## Progress towards using MongoDB

-   [ ] On bot load, poll all character traits and update `custom` status and max value for traits in enums. This will keep database in-sync with the codebase.
-   [ ] Update README.md to reflect mongodb and env variables
-   [ ] Review .env
-   [ ] New ci workflows so pytest has a database to test against
