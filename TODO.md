However, your rating in your character's "creed Virtue" - her primary Virtue - cannot be exceeded by her score in any other Virtue. Thus, a Defender's Zeal rating cannot be exceeded by her Vision or Mercy ratings - she could have 3 Zeal; 2 Zeal, 1 Vision and 0 Mercy; or one point in each. Likewise, a Redeemer's Mercy cannot be exceeded by her Zeal or Vision ratings.
